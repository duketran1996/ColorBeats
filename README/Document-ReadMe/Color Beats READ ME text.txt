Pass Functionality: 
_All buttons generate sound as expected. 
_Analyze color and error message shows correct. 

Fail Functionality:
_The sound library is small so if there are more than 7 buttons, the program wonâ€™t play sound. Except for the red and black color, they can play sound of note of piano and violin up to 11 buttons. 

Improvement:
_The program should play the instrument note level according to the color of the button rather than playing all level of notes for the same color of button. For example: if there are black color and there are 3 buttons that has the same color gradient of black. The note will stays the same even if you click on button 1 2 3. For a different gradient of black, the note will be different.
_Process time for analyzing high level needs to be faster.
